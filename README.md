Welcome to our Cardiologs **coding challenge**.

The main goal of this interview is for us to assess your level of expertise in the Front-End ecosystem but to also understand your developer habits and evaluate your coding skills ! 
If it is a match this is fantastic!! You are a step closer to be part of the team!! :blush:

We offer 3 options during the Technical Interview: 
 1. **Coding** a small web application
 2. **Code reviewing** of an existing code base
 3. **Open format** share us some of the code you have developed and you are excited to discuss

In all this 3 options it is important for us to have access of your technical interview code **BEFORE** the interview meeting so we have time to review your work and prepare some constructive feedback ! 
The goal is for all of us to learn from each others.  

## Share with us
If you are using a private repository on GitHub, add us as a collaborator (`buenjybar`, `baptooo` and `ArthurFoucher`) so we can read your code. 
Otherwise share us your code in a zip file ( please do not include `node_modules` and `binaries` ..)

## And of course HAVE FUN!!

# Option 1: Coding

In this option we are going to code a small Web Application to help the Nurse to better manage the patient flow in the hospital.  

During this session of ~2-4h, we will evaluate your code skills on multiple aspects!!
It is important to read all the instructions before to start your chrono ⏱!,

### Instructions
We are trying to build a Triage Patient's cards that can move cards from the _Todo_ column to the _Done_ column
  - Fetch the patient cards using our local server [instructions](#Server)
  - Display the patient cards in the corresponding column (_Pending_ + _Rejected_ and _Done_)
  - Allow user to change the card status from _Pending_ or _Rejected_ to _Done_ and from _Done_ to _Rejected_.
  - Add a local filtering by patient name and arrhythmia.
  
A particular attention will be taken to your Code Structure, your ability to express data models and UX-UI components structure.

### Requirements
You can choose **any** of the following solution, but we expect to have a clean file structure on your final project.

Set up your project with one of our project CLI recommendations
- Angular [cli](https://cli.angular.io/)
- React [reactApp](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/)
- VueJS [vuecli](https://cli.vuejs.org/)
- Vanilla

Of course, you are free to use any of the **CSS naming** convention / methodology, or any **testing** libraries other than the one provided by the CLI.

### Design specs
Because no feature is developed without a nice pseudo-design, here is a quick sketch of how we think we can display the list.

### Let's Go! Be **creative** !!

### Bonus points
- UI/UX design
- Writing unit tests
- CSS animations
- Using Typescript

### Server
How to use it?
Here is a simple instruction on how to set up your local server for the project

1. First install the node dependencies
    `npm install`

2. Run the local API server
    `npm run api`

3. With everything set up, you can now access the list of cards with the following URL:
    `GET http://localhost:3000/cards`


### Timing
*Don't forget to share with us the time you have spent on this project.*

Feel free to give us your feedback on this Homework, we will be more than happy to adapt it :blue_heart:.


# Option 2: Code reviewing

You can jump to the `codereview/` folder and install the packages

You can fork this project and add some more commits to Fix / Improve the existing homework

Don't forget to share your code with our Technical Interview reviewers [here](#share-with-us)

# Option 3: Share us your code

You have written some nice code that you are pretty proud of and you cannot wait to share it with us!
Let's talk about it during our interview! 
Please don't forget to share your code, functions or anything related so we can understand the context and being able to run the code :wink:
